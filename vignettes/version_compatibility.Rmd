Each version of **acronymsdown** is tested against several versions of
R and Pandoc to ensure all the features are correctly working.

The following image summarizes the current compatibility:

## Notes on Pandoc versions

Lua Filters are available in Pandoc since the 2.0 version, thus **acronymsdown**
requires this version as a bare minimum.

However, the various versions of Pandoc since then have introduced changes,
more or less breaking compatibility.
For a better experience, and whenever possible, it is recommended to use
one of the most recent versions of Pandoc.

For example, Pandoc before 2.11.2 used a different syntax for headings
(`Setext`), which makes our tests fail, as we expect the `ATX` syntax (more
standard, and default since 2.11.2).
The `--atx-headers` option can be used in versions < 2.11.2, however it is
deprecated since 2.11.2, and we prefer not to use it in our tests to not
clutter the results with warnings.

Thus, versions before 2.11.2 are not automatically tested with **acronymsdown**.
They may work, but are not recommended.

Additionally, as RStudio provides its own version of Pandoc (bundled), and
most RMarkdown users will rely on RStudio, we also test for the same version.
Thus, RStudio users should be able to assume that **acronymsdown** will work
on their system without having to download another version of Pandoc.

## Test details

The [tests](https://github.com/rchaput/acronymsdown/tree/master/tests) are
implemented as a set of folders (one for each test), which all contain:

- an `input.Rmd` Markdown document, which uses the feature we wish to test ;
- an `expected.md` document, which describes the expected result when passing
  the `input.Rmd` through Pandoc.

The automated tests use RMarkdown to render each of the `input.Rmd` files,
and compare the results to the `expected.md` document, for each test.
