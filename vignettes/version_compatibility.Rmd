Each version of **acronymsdown** is tested against several versions of
R and Pandoc to ensure all the features are correctly working.

The following image summarizes the current compatibility:

## Notes on Pandoc versions

Lua Filters are available in Pandoc since the 2.0 version, thus **acronymsdown**
requires this version as a bare minimum.

However, the various versions of Pandoc since then have introduced changes,
more or less breaking compatibility.
For a better experience, and whenever possible, it is recommended to use
one of the most recent versions of Pandoc.

Additionally, as RStudio provides its own version of Pandoc (bundled), and
most RMarkdown users will rely on RStudio, we also test for the same version.
Thus, RStudio users should be able to assume that **acronymsdown** will work
on their system without having to download another version of Pandoc.

## Test details

The [tests](https://github.com/rchaput/acronymsdown/tree/master/tests) are
implemented as a set of folders (one for each test), which all contain:

- an `input.Rmd` Markdown document, which uses the feature we wish to test ;
- an `expected.md` document, which describes the expected result when passing
  the `input.Rmd` through Pandoc.

The automated tests use RMarkdown to render each of the `input.Rmd` files,
and compare the results to the `expected.md` document, for each test.

The tests rely on our custom output format, `acronymsdown::md_format` to
ensure reliable results (for example, that all headings use the ATX syntax).
However, **acronymsdown** works with most output formats.

You may use `acronymsdown::md_format` if you wish to produce Markdown files,
but be warned that this format includes some opinionated choices (such as
the ATX headings aforementioned).
To control every aspect of the document production, it is advised to use
a more basic format, such as `rmarkdown::md_document`, and to specify the
various parameters.
Another option would be to create another custom format, as advised in
`vignette("advanced_usage")`. In this case, you may read our
`acronymsdown::md_format` as an example of custom format.
