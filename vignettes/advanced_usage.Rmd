## Using other Pandoc arguments

The default syntax, `pandoc_args: !expr acronymsdown::add_filter()` is
effective for getting quickly set up, but does not allow registering
other Pandoc arguments.

When other arguments are necessary, for example `wrap=preserve`, an
alternative syntax can be used to specify all arguments as a list:

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    pandoc_args:
     - !expr acronymsdown::add_filter()
     - --wrap=preserve
     - Other arguments here...
---
```

As in `vignette("acronymsdown")`, please note that `pdf_document` is
only used as an example. Other output formats can be used, and if multiple
output formats are declared in the metadata, the `pandoc_args` list should
be duplicated. The arguments themselves may be different for each format,
with the exception of `!expr acronymsdown::add_filter()` that should be
used in all formats.

For example:

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    - !expr acronymsdown::add_filter()
    - --wrap=preserve
  html_document:
    - !expr acronymsdown::add_filter()
    - --shift-heading-level-by=1
---
```

## Defining acronyms in external file(s)

Whereas defining acronyms directly in the YAML metadata is the most
straightforward way, **acronymsdown** also support reading definitions
from one (or several) pseudo-YAML file.

To do so, simply specify the file path in the `fromfile` attribute of
the YAML metadata.
This behaviour is particularly useful if you want to define acronyms
in the same file for multiple projects, or generate it automatically,
in a similar way to the `.bib` files for LaTeX citations.

This attribute may be either a single path, for example:

```yaml
---
acronyms:
  fromfile: ./acronyms.yml
---
```

or a list of paths, for example:

```yaml
---
acronyms:
  fromfile:
    - ./acronyms1.yml
    - ./acronyms2.yml
---
```

Note that the path may be either absolute or relative. If the path is
relative, it is resolved with respect to the current working directory
of Pandoc. By default, when using `rmarkdown`, this working directory is
set to the directory containing the source Rmd file.

In our examples, we thus assume that the `acronyms.yml` (respectively,
`acronyms1.yml` and `acronyms2.yml`) live in the same folder as the Rmd
document.

The content of such files must be as following:

```yaml
---
acronyms:
  keys:
    # Define your keys here
    - shortname: Rmd
      longname: RMarkdown document
---
```

Please note that this format is not really YAML~; instead, the files are
read as Markdown documents themselves, hence the presence of the `---`
fences.

However, only the metadata and more specifically the `acronyms.keys` field
is used. No other option is taken into account. The eventual document
body is ignored as well.

The acronyms are read in the following order:

1. Acronyms in the `acronyms.key` field of the source Rmd document, in
  sequential order.
2. Acronyms in each of the `acronyms.fromfile` files.
    a. Files are read in sequential order.
    b. Acronyms inside each file are also read in sequential order.

This order is meaningful in 2 cases:

- When a duplicate key is found, the behaviour (`keep` or `replace`)
  depends on the order in which acronyms are read.
- When the `initial` sorting is used, the List Of Acronyms displays
  acronyms in the same order as they were defined.
